# HORISEON Project - Bootcamp Week 1
## Week 1 Assignment - Refactor code for accessibility

This week, we were tasked with refactoring a webpage to conform to the generally accepted accessibility standards. This includes:

- Using semantic HTML elements (main, section, aside, header, footer etc - ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)
- Adding alt tags to images to allow them to be read by screen readers
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- CSS is consolidated and well commented
- Logical structure of elements
